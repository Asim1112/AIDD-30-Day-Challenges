## Prompt

/sp.tasks

Context for task generation: In this phase, we will create separate functions for each mathematical operation and implement logic to handle invalid or unexpected inputs. Next, we will build a simple Streamlit UI that includes number input fields and operation buttons. These buttons will be connected to the logic generated by Gemini CLI so that the calculations run smoothly. Finally, we will test the calculator with different input values to ensure accuracy and proper error handling.

## Response snapshot

The `tasks.md` file has been generated at `specs/001-calculator-ui/tasks.md`. It contains 16 tasks broken down by user story. The project is now ready for implementation.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created a detailed, actionable task list for implementing the Calculator UI feature.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run.
- 📁 Files: 
  - `specs/001-calculator-ui/tasks.md`
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.implement
- 🧠 Reflection: The prerequisite check script failed, but I was able to proceed by manually identifying the necessary design documents. The agent-native PHR creation continues to be a reliable fallback.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: Script execution failure.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): n/a
- Prompt variant (if applicable): n/a
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): n/a
